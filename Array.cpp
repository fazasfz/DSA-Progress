Here are some common and interesting questions about arrays in C++ that can help you practice and deepen your understanding:
Basic Questions
What is an array in C++?
Explain the concept of arrays and their purpose in programming.
How do you declare and initialize an array in C++?
Example: int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
What is the difference between a one-dimensional and a multi-dimensional array?
Provide examples of both.
How do you access and modify elements in an array?
Example: arr[2] = 10;
Intermediate Questions
Write a program to find the largest and smallest element in an array.
How do you calculate the sum and average of elements in an array?
Explain how to reverse an array in C++.
Example: Reverse arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} to {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}.
What happens if you try to access an array index out of bounds?
Discuss undefined behavior in C++.
How do you pass an array to a function in C++?
Example: Write a function to calculate the sum of array elements.
Advanced Questions
How do you sort an array in ascending or descending order?
Example: Use the std::sort function from the <algorithm> library.
Write a program to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
How do you find duplicate elements in an array?
Explain the difference between static and dynamic arrays in C++.
Example: Use new and delete for dynamic memory allocation.
How do you implement a 2D array and perform matrix operations (e.g., addition, multiplication)?
Write a program to rotate an array by a given number of positions.
Example: Rotate {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} by 2 positions to {3, 4, 5, 1, 2}.
Challenge Questions
How do you find the subarray with the maximum sum?
Example: Implement Kadane's Algorithm.
Write a program to find the intersection and union of two arrays.
How do you implement a sparse matrix using arrays?
Explain how pointers can be used to manipulate arrays in C++.
How do you find the majority element in an array (an element that appears more than n/2 times)?
