# ðŸ§  Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my DSA practice while learning from [Udemy DSA Course by Abdul Bari] and solving problems topic-wise.

I'm building strong foundations in data structures and problem-solving with consistent learning and implementation.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- [x] Arrays
- [x] Structures
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ] Stacks & Queues
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] Searching & Sorting
- [ ] Hashing
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Dynamic Programming

Each topic is organized into folders with:
- âœ… Code files (questions solved)
- âœ… Practice problems/questions
- âœ… Notes or key concepts (where necessary)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Complete Udemy course + problem sets
- Track my DSA journey consistently
- Build a solid base for technical interviews
