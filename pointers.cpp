/*Here are some commonly asked questions about pointers in C++ that can help you understand and practice the concept:

Basic Questions
What is a pointer in C++? How is it different from a regular variable?
How do you declare and initialize a pointer in C++?
What does the * (dereference) operator do in the context of pointers?
What is the & (address-of) operator, and how is it used with pointers?
Explain the difference between a null pointer and an uninitialized pointer.
Intermediate Questions
How do you dynamically allocate memory using pointers in C++? Provide an example using new and delete.
What is the difference between int *ptr and int* ptr? Are they the same?
How do you use pointers with arrays? Explain with an example.
What is a dangling pointer, and how can it be avoided?
How can you pass a pointer to a function? What are the advantages of doing so?
Advanced Questions
What is a smart pointer in C++? How does it differ from a raw pointer?
Explain the concept of pointer arithmetic. How can you iterate through an array using pointers?
What are double pointers (int**)? Provide an example of their usage.
How do pointers work with classes and objects in C++? Provide an example of accessing class members using pointers.
What are function pointers, and how are they used in C++? Provide an example.
Practical Coding Challenges
Write a program to swap two numbers using pointers.
Implement a program to reverse an array using pointers.
Create a dynamic 2D array using pointers and demonstrate how to access its elements.
Write a program to demonstrate the use of std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr.
Implement a program to find the largest element in an array using pointer arithmetic.

These questions cover a range of difficulty levels and will help you build a solid understanding of pointers in C++. Let me know if you'd like detailed explanations or code examples for any of these!*/
